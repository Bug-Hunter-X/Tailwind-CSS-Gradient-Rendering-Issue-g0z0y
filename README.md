# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradient classes. The issue involves unexpected rendering behavior or missing styles when applying gradients to elements.

## Bug Description

The code uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a linear gradient background.  However, the gradient either doesn't render correctly, appears partially, or is completely missing.  This may be due to various factors, including conflicting styles, incorrect class usage, or issues with the Tailwind CSS configuration.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the project (instructions may vary depending on the project setup).
3. Observe the rendered output and note the unexpected behavior of the gradient.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the CSS classes used, ensuring there aren't conflicting styles overriding the gradient, and verifying the correct installation and configuration of Tailwind CSS.  The solution file provides a corrected implementation.
